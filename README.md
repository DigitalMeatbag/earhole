# earhole

Doin' it to ya in ya earhole.

This is a C# WPF application that captures live audio data from the system loopback using WASAPI and visualizes it in real-time using SkiaSharp, creating a dynamic spectrum analyzer with colorful bars.

## Features

- Real-time audio spectrum visualization with selectable modes
- **Advanced Beat Detection**: Multi-band analysis system that adapts to song tempo (60-200 BPM) with peak detection, onset flux analysis, and sub-bass frequency targeting for accurate beat tracking across all music genres
- **Now Playing integration**: Displays current track from Spotify and other media players
- Fullscreen mode (press F or F11)
- Graceful exit with farewell message (press Q or Esc)
- Startup message when audio is detected
- Smooth animations and color transitions
- Mode menu (press ` to toggle)

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (WASAPI is Windows-specific)
  - **Minimum**: Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later for media integration
- .NET 6.0 Runtime (for running published version) or .NET 6.0 SDK (for building from source)
- Stereo mix/loopback audio device enabled in Windows sound settings (for capturing system audio)

## Libraries Used

- **NAudio**: For WASAPI loopback audio capture
- **MathNet.Numerics**: For FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) calculations
- **SkiaSharp.Views.WPF**: For high-performance 2D graphics rendering in WPF
- **SkiaSharp.Svg & Svg.Skia**: For SVG rendering support (used in Cold War mode)

## How to Run

### Option 1: Run from Source (Requires .NET SDK)

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open a terminal in the project directory
3. Run `dotnet run`
4. The application window will open
5. Play audio on your system to see the visualization

  - **8**: Dance
- **Window Close Button**: Normal window close

**Note**: Number keys work with both the top row and numpad.

## Now Playing Integration

earhole automatically detects and displays track information from media players running on your system:

- **Supported Players**: Works with Spotify, iTunes, MusicBee, VLC, web browsers, and other media apps using Windows Media Session API
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically prioritizes music players over video editors and other non-music apps
- **Spotify Fallback**: If Spotify doesn't expose metadata via the Windows API, earhole automatically reads the window title as a fallback
- **Display Modes**:
  - **Temporary (default)**: Track info fades in when a song starts, displays for 3 seconds, then fades out
  - **Persistent**: Press **I** to toggle; track info remains visible continuously in the top-left corner
- **Automatic Updates**: Track info updates automatically when songs change

**Note**: Track detection works best when only one media player is active. If multiple apps are playing media (e.g., Spotify and a video editor), close or pause non-music apps for best results.

## Visualization Modes

- **🔀 Shuffle** (default): Automatically cycles through all visualizer modes every 30 seconds with true randomization; never shows the same mode twice in a row. Perfect for variety during long listening sessions. Press **0** again while in shuffle mode to manually skip to a new random mode.
- **📊 Spectrum Bars**: 1024-bin spectrum analyzer with ROYGBIV coloring; bars scale with volume and frequency content.

- **✨ Particles**: Audio-reactive particle field launched from the bottom; color and velocity respond to frequency/intensity.
	- ![Particles](assets/earhole-particles.png)
- **⭕ The Circle**: Circular spectrum visualizer where frequencies ripple outward from center; segments are colored red (expanding), white (stable), or blue (contracting) based on velocity.
	- ![The Circle](assets/earhole-the-circle.png)
- **♾️ Two Circles**: Dual circular visualizers displaying true stereo separation with continuous color cycling. Left channel (left circle, clockwise) and right channel (right circle, counter-clockwise) each use two dynamically cycling colors: one for expansion and one for contraction. The four colors (left outward, left inward, right outward, right inward) are always distinct, cycling through the full HSV spectrum at 90-degree offsets to maintain maximum separation. White indicates stable/neutral state. Beat detection triggers both circles to compress inward and spawn compression waves that propagate toward the centers while fading out. Each wave's color is calculated as the intensity-weighted average of its parent circle's spectrum at the moment of the beat, creating a visual representation of which frequencies are most active. The mirrored rotation directions (left clockwise, right counter-clockwise) create a symmetrical visual effect that emphasizes stereo imaging and phase relationships through additive segment blending.

- **🧚 Fairies**: Seven ROYGBIV fairies fly organically across the screen, each tracking a dynamic frequency range; glow intensity reflects audio activity, speed and movement erraticism increase with rising intensity.

- **🌊 The Wave**: Dual-channel waveform visualizer with stereo separation; right channel (red) displays upward, left channel (blue) displays downward. Beat detection triggers color change to white and spawns colorful glowing particles at random positions.

- **💥 Cold War**: Interactive geopolitical visualizer displaying an authentic 1980s world map with Soviet (red) and Western (blue) alliance territories. Audio spectrum samples trigger territorial events: left channel dominance creates small defensive explosions, while right channel dominance launches arcing missiles toward opposing territories with large impact explosions. Beat detection doubles explosion brightness for dramatic sync with the music's rhythm.
	- ![Cold War](assets/earhole-cold-war.png)
- **🕺 The Dance**: Concert crowd simulation with 40-80 animated stick figure dancers positioned in perspective depth. Features include: independent limb movement and physical variation per dancer (height, proportions), randomized animation timing for natural crowd motion, intensity-triggered lighter raising (5% probability, 30s cooldown, 4-6s duration with random flame colors), 12 audio-reactive lasers (6 stage lasers sweep outward, 6 ceiling lasers sweep inward with color cycling), beat-synchronized crowd jump ripple that propagates from stage to back, and subtle screen flash effects on beats. Each dancer responds to different frequency bands creating a dynamic concert atmosphere.

All modes update in real time. Switch modes using:
- **Backtick (`)**: Open visual mode menu
- **Number keys (0-8)**: Instantly switch to specific modes (see Controls section above)

When you select shuffle mode, it resumes automatic cycling. When you select a specific mode, it stays on that mode until you change it.

## Building from Source

If you want to modify the code:

1. Install .NET 6.0 SDK
2. Run `dotnet build` to compile
3. Run `dotnet run` to test
4. To create your own published version: `dotnet publish earhole.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --no-self-contained -o publish`

### Automated Release Build

For convenience, use the included PowerShell script to automate the entire release process:

```powershell
.\build-release.ps1
```

This script will:
- Clean the publish directory
- Build the project in Release mode
- Publish as a framework-dependent executable (requires .NET 6.0 Runtime)
- Create a timestamped ZIP archive (e.g., `earhole-v2025-12-29.zip`)

The ZIP contains the executable, necessary DLLs, and the assets folder. Distribute the ZIP as-is; users should extract and run `earhole.exe` from the extracted folder (do not move the exe or assets out of that folder).

## Troubleshooting

- **No visualization**: Ensure stereo mix/loopback is enabled in Windows Sound settings
- **Audio not detected**: Check that applications are playing audio through the system
- **Performance issues**: The app uses FFT on audio samples; ensure your system can handle real-time processing
